				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So today I updated WordPress to 2.6.5. And like every other time, it was a cinch, all over and done in less than five minutes. Thanks, WordPress guys!</p>
<p>In other news, I have been geeking out with both the iPhone SDK and the Android SDK, and I believe I have a little something special going here. I hope to have it ready for release, on both platforms, sometime in January. Development continues.</p>
<p>I will need beta testers soon. Any T-Mobile G1 users interested in helping out, you can email me at dreadpiratepj [at] gmail [dot] com</p>
<p>Speaking of Android, I started playing with it now that the source code to the whole thing has been released. I managed to get Android booting on a Palm TX, but it still needs a lot of work. It boots, but it doesn&#8217;t do crap once it boots. <img src="tp/blawgwp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I get all the way to the &#8220;Press the MENU key to unlock&#8221; screen, but none of the keys do anything. Neither does touching the screen. It&#8217;s an issue with the Linux kernel drivers and device configuration. It just wasn&#8217;t made to run on a Palm TX without proper tweaking of the source. I just don&#8217;t know what the proper tweaking is.</p>
<p>I need to look in my bag of loot for a Palm serial cable (I&#8217;m sure I have one somewhere) and hopefully I can get a serial console from which to poke around inside Android.</p>
<p>I do have Android running successfully on my Sprint Touch (my parents, my sister and I have a family plan on Sprint.) Credit for that goes to <a href="http://it029000.massey.ac.nz/vogue">Dr. Martin Johnson in New Zeland</a>. I just use his release on my phone (before you ask, no, his release doesn&#8217;t work on the Palm TX. It&#8217;s the first thing I tried. <img src="tp/blawgwp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
