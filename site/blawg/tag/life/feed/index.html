				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some months ago, I received a message from someone on LinkedIn, asking why I had not updated this blog in the last few years. And frankly, I didn&#8217;t have a good reason. Posting new content just didn&#8217;t continue being a priority. In truth, I posted more stuff on my Facebook wall after July of 2009 than I had posted on this blog in its entire lifetime.</p>
<h2>A quick recap on the last 2.9 years<br />
</h2>
<ul>
<li>After speaking at OSCON 2009, I moved to Silicon Valley for a job at mobile gaming startup OpenFeint</li>
<li>I worked on another iPhone games development book, <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430225997/">Beginning iPhone Games Development</a></li>
<li>I freelanced as an iPhone/Rails developer for a few Silicon Valley companies</li>
<li>For the last year, I have been working as an iOS developer for a high tech orchard in Cupertino <img src="tp://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>I fell in love and got engaged</li>
</ul>
<p>The move to Silicon Valley has been great for me in terms of employment and quality of life. I&#8217;m working in a great, growing field, and loving it. I love all the diversity in the SF Bay area. And I love northern CA weather.</p>
<p>During this time I have kept increasingly busy with work. When I was a freelancer, my spare time between projects was spent trying to get new customers. As any freelancer will tell you, acquiring new projects and customers is as much a full-time effort as working on the projects you get.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m working full-time with an established company, I don&#8217;t have to worry about where my next gig is going to come from. So this focuses my work efforts between 9 am to 6 pm most weeks. This leaves me a bit of leisure time in between work and spending time with my fianc&eacute;e and friends.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the main topic of this blog entry: what I will be doing different in what&#8217;s left of 2012 and the years ahead.</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to work in video games, ever since I was a teenager learning programming on a family computer in the mid-80s. So starting with this blog entry, I will put more focus into releasing my first mobile game.</p>
<p>People much busier than I have gotten games and apps published. I&#8217;m single, have no kids, my job is not all consuming. I have no excuse. I simply let distractions occupy my time. Things like TV, leisure reading, social networking.</p>
<p>I actually have wanted to make a mobile game for over three years. I have several ideas always in the back burner. I haven&#8217;t accomplished it because I haven&#8217;t put in the time and effort it needs. Part of it is because I&#8217;ve been busy, but part of it is setting the goal and getting it done. Simple as that. This needs to go from &#8220;want&#8221; to &#8220;goal&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve watched the movie &#8220;City Slickers&#8221;, you are probably familiar with the character named Curly, played by Jack Palance. In one scene, Curly tells Mitch (played by Billie Crystal) &#8220;Do you know what the secret to life is?&#8221; The answer is &#8220;One thing. Just one thing. You stick to that and the rest don&#8217;t mean shit.&#8221; The problem is in figuring out what your &#8220;one thing&#8221; is.</p>
<p>The problem with me and goals is that I&#8217;m too easily distracted by a very curious mind and way too many different interests. So the key to my achieving goals is to really focus. Just having the time available or making time isn&#8217;t enough.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done this before, when I worked on the two iOS game development books. It took 90% of my effort just to focus. The other 10% was the actual writing. <img src="tp/blawgwp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So with that, I finish this blog post and I&#8217;m going to enjoy my Friday night. It&#8217;s my fianc&eacute;e&#8217;s birthday today, so we are going out to dinner. No game hacking tonight. But there&#8217;s the rest of the weekend and next week.</p>
<p>As I make progress, I&#8217;ll be posting details of how things are going.</p>
<p>Onward with the geekiness!</p>
<p><b>Note: I meant to publish this a few weeks ago but got caught up doing different things and didn&#8217;t publish. Except for my fianc√©e&#8217;s birthday, which is on the day this was published, the other events and decisions documented here are already a couple weeks old and in progress.</b></p>

<p>The mobile software market is becoming very exciting, and I&#8217;ve been watching with interest. I&#8217;ve been learning iPhone development for the last ten months, first with the jailbreak toolchain, and in the last six months with the official SDK. Likewise, I&#8217;ve been dabbling with the Android SDK.</p>
<p>Many people have compared the growth of mobile software in the last year to the amazing growth of the early PC era.</p>
<p>One difference from those years, is that mobile software is already mainstream. The &#8220;personal computer&#8221; took about 20 years to &#8220;catch on,&#8221; from the introduction of the Apple I in 1977, to the Windows boom of the mid-90s. In contrast, Apple has sold over 10 million iPhones in the last 11 months alone. There are few consumers that aren&#8217;t at least aware of the iPhone&#8217;s existence. T-Mobile sold about a million Android-powered G1 phones in only one month of pre-sale orders from existing T-Mobile customers. The device can now be ordered online for new and existing accounts, although demand is expected to be very high, causing possible shortages. They claim they can sell another million G1 phones between now and the end of the year.</p>
<p>Another difference is the barrier to entry. Computers cost thousands of dollars in the 1980s, and were not as easy to use and develop for at the beginning. To be a developer back then, you had to be a computer engineer or someone with previous software development experience on mainframes or minicomputers, which at the time was not as widespread knowledge as in these dime-a-dozen-MCSD days. The barrier to entry was very high, economically and educationally. The barrier to entry for iPhone and Android development is very low, with devices available for less than $200 USD. If you already develop software, be it for the web, intranets, or desktops, you already have most of the skills, and a computer with which to develop. So the cost of development tools and training for these platforms is very low, especially for Android. How come it is lower for Android development, you ask?</p>
<p>To develop for the iPhone App Store, you need to already own a Mac with Leopard 10.5.4. So if you don&#8217;t have a Mac, that&#8217;s an extra expense. With Android, you can use the computer you already have. <a href="http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2008/03/06/apple-announces-app-store-for-iphone-ipod-touch/">To put your application on the iPhone App Store, you need to pay $99 USD + tax to Apple and submit your application and say please</a> and cross your eyes and dot your tease (double pun intended, if perhaps lame.) You can sell Android apps from the trunk of your car at a flea market if you want, but to <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2008/10/android-market-now-available-for-users.html">sell them on the Android Market you need to pay $25 USD</a>, although there is no validation or approval process. For either iPhone or Android, you need to buy a device to test on real hardware and make sure things run well.</p>
<p>Of course, you can always develop iPhone software for the iPhone jailbreak community, using the computer you already own, without having to pay anyone a cent, nor having to seek permission. You will still need a device on which to test on, which brings you up to par with Android in terms of barrier to entry. But then you&#8217;d be limiting your market to the 20 to 30 % of iPhone users who jailbreak their device. 200,000 &#8211; 300,000 and growing is not a bad number of potential users, though. Many of today&#8217;s software giants were founded when PC user numbers were much lower.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I digress. My point is that just like I heard the call of the wild and left full-time employment in a Java consulting shop for freelance web work in Rails nearly three years ago, I hear the winds of change and opportunity roaring by. And I want to get my kite out and test the wind.</p>
<p>As you can see, I&#8217;ve researched the market. I&#8217;m going to cut back on freelance web projects, to start dedicating time to developing a growing stable of ad-supported and for pay mobile apps, for both iPhone and Android. I can bootstrap this effort and support myself for two years on only a small portion of my savings. I believe there is enough growth in the mobile apps market to make back my investment and grow it a little bit. The monetary barrier to entry is so low, the only risk is time and effort lost if things don&#8217;t work out. If that happens, I can always go back to what I did before. But I&#8217;m not going to forgive myself if I don&#8217;t try this.</p>
<p>There will be other related news soon. <img src="tp/blawgwp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Meanwhile, enjoy the breeeeezeeeee. Ha ha!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(This post was inspired by <a href="http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/wordpress/2008/07/23/lunches-at-the-beach/">Evil Genius Chronicles, Lunches at the Beach.</a>)</p>
<p>I grew up in this very town, 37 miles west of San Juan on the north shore of Puerto Rico. This very house where I live now was my grandfather&#8217;s house when I was eight years old. It later became my home, from ages 11 to 17. After graduating from high school, I went to Pennsylvania, PA to study Computer Science and got a job straight out of college. I moved here again almost seven years ago, when the dot com bust left me looking for a job.</p>
<p>I live 5 minutes from the beach, a beautiful bay, in my not so humble opinion.</p>
<p><img src="tp://farm2.static.flickr.com/1214/1347326731_665c2f3077.jpg" /></p>
<p><img src="tp://farm2.static.flickr.com/1286/1347328105_53451c7503.jpg" /></p>
<p><img src="tp://farm2.static.flickr.com/1110/1347329303_9e3572f7cc.jpg" /></p>
<p><img src="tp://farm2.static.flickr.com/1058/1348217734_43364219cb.jpg" /></p>
<p>I loved the beach growing up. I visited the beach every chance I got, even though I didn&#8217;t learn to swim properly till I was 16 years old. I just liked to walk the beach, sink my toes in the warm sand, or chill my feet in the water. And my beach has these great hulks of stone nearly three stories high (eolianite according to <a href="http://geology.uprm.edu/Morelock/cstsys.htm">this page</a> .) I loved climbing them and sitting at the very top and just stare out over the endless stretch of the north Atlantic on the horizon. At different times of the week, you can see the cruise ships heading for the Bahamas or Florida, just a half mile or so from the rocks.</p>
<p><img src="tp://farm3.static.flickr.com/2081/2173451500_3c901b04bf.jpg" /></p>
<p>As mentioned at the beginning, after I graduated high school I studied and worked in southeastern Pennsylvania and the North Carolina piedmont for 13 years, several hundred miles from the nearest beach. You can&#8217;t imagine the joy I felt every time I returned home on vacation to visit family during those years and stopped to visit this beach. I&#8217;m sorry, eastern USA residents, but your beaches are lame. And don&#8217;t even get me started about Lake Erie and Lake Michigan. Psh!</p>
<p><img src="tp://farm3.static.flickr.com/2322/2173454836_b0449130b1.jpg" /></p>
<p>For the last two years, I&#8217;ve been working from home as a freelance software developer and tech writer. I pretty much can keep my own hours and so I make a point of taking an hour break at least twice in my work week, to head to my beach, just 5 short miles away. There are times I just take the whole weekend away from computers, work, everything (except my iPod and my fiction reading stash.) Sometimes I feel so burned out I just sleep all day on a hammock, less than twenty yards from the breaking waves. The sound of the waves and the steady cool breeze lulls me to sleep every time.</p>
<p>Every year since I moved back here, I ask myself if I want to move back to the USA mainland. And this beach is one of the few reasons I&#8217;ve stayed as long as I have.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to write this post before 2008 started, but better late than never, huh?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working with Ruby on Rails for over 18 months now, and it continues to be a lot of fun. There are still challenges, as projects are never a total walk in the park. There is also new stuff to learn almost every week. The Rails team keeps improving the framework, and the community keeps authoring more plugins. Keeping up is a demanding part of the job, but it adds to the fun factor.</p>
<p>One activity I&#8217;ve been doing lately on my own time is learning different programming languages, development environments, and frameworks. The move to Rails from Java seems to have been a good choice career-wise, and I did it by trying to keep current on technology. I want to be ready for the next shift, whatever that may happen to be and whenever it comes into prominence.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>After many attempts, I finally had published not just one IT-related article, but three, at IBM DeveloperWorks and Amazon Web Services Developer Portal. The articles were published between late October and late December 2007. They are:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-php-xpath/"> Display Google Calendar events on your PHP Web site with XPath</a></p>
<p><a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=1011"> Don&#8217;t Get Caught with Your Instance Down</a></p>
<p><a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=1085"> Using Parameterized Launches to Customize Your AMIs</a></p>
<p>These articles are just the start of a shift from developing software as one of the faceless multitude of IT geeks, to being somewhat more known among my peers. I hope to turn these and other articles into presentations at software development conferences in 2008. Hopefully this enhanced exposure and networking will lead to great new things in 2008 and beyond.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Just before beginning this post, I updated WordPress to the latest stable version. I am always amazed by how easy WordPress upgrades are. Considering how easy it is to write unmaintainable crap in PHP, the WordPress team deserves a big standing ovation for doing software right in PHP.</p>
<p>The theme I had up for the last year was not compatible with the change to WordPress 2.3.x, so I picked out a totally different theme this once. It&#8217;s really simple and unobtrusive. If I get creative, I may tweak it or pick another theme altogether.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for now. I&#8217;ll try to post more often. Feel free to give me a nudge in the comments if I let posting to the weblog slide again.</p>
