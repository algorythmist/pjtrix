				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just got word from my editor at Developer.com that my latest article was published yesterday.</p>
<p>The article is called &#8220;Writing Facebook Applications with Java EE&#8221; and you can find it <a href="http://www.developer.com/java/article.php/3733751">here</a>.</p>
<p>The amount of information out there on writing Facebook apps with Java is scarce, and what is out there for Java Facebook applications, is often incomplete. I hope the article helps Java Facebook developers start on the right foot.</p>
<p>It was interesting returning to work with Java, even if only for the few weekends during which I wrote this article. I hadn&#8217;t developed in Java at all in almost two years. I was surprised I hadn&#8217;t forgotten any important details.</p>
<p>I have another article for Amazon Web Services submitted and in the editing pipeline. It should be coming out in the next few weeks</p>
