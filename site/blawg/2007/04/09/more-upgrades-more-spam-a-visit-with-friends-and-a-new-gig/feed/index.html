		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ken, thanks for visiting!

I know a little bit about how to navigate from VA to PA. When I used to live in Greensboro, NC, I consulted for Atlantic Mutual Insurance Companies in Roanoke. And my ex-wife&#039;s stepfather&#039;s family and my friends lived in PA. We used to drive up to PA from NC during the holidays. Took Rt 202 from Greensboro to Roanoke, and Interstate 81 from Roanoke to Harrisburg and other points northeast.

I&#039;ll be sure to give you a visit some time. We can hit the ABC store for some bourbon or whiskey worth sampling. :-D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[PJ:

Congrats on the new gig, and you won&#039;t be far away  from me after the move.   It is possible to navigate from here to there without driving the stinking I-95.

I&#039;m up to my neck in Linux clusters  and GFS filesystems; those days will pass, and I&#039;ll get back in the TWAC race of blogging and commenting ;)

I haven&#039;t done justice to either over the last month or so.
