				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve crash-landed on an alien planet. While walking around the planet, you find plants. Each time you eat a plant, you change shape and color! Whoa! Some plants have a long term effect, but some only change your shape and color for a short time. There are monsters and animals, most are friendly, but some are territorial and can do you damage! There are also precious stones of different colors, which you can pick up and carry on your head. You also find secret doors with the inscription &#8220;3FA&#8221;. Does that mean what you think it means? Three-factor authentication? What is behind these doors? And how are you going to get back home?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be using this cute spritesheet / tileset made by Kenney that I found at OpenGameArt.org ( http://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-deluxe )</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a little colder in hell as I write this. If you look out your nearest window, you&#8217;re likely to see monkeys flying on the backs of pigs. Which means Armaggedon is starting any day now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Microsoft has recently released a public beta of IE8. Standards and security are of top importance in this release. To that end, the IE team is planning on releasing IE8 in full standards mode. Releasing in Full Standards Mode offers many benefits in the long term, but short term, could cause some end-user and developer issues. We would love to understand your thoughts around the impact of this specific issue and invite your suggestions on how we can best communicate it.</p>
<p>If you have thoughts and feedback on IE 8 releasing in full standards mode, please respond to the questions below and send your reply to jasontil@microsoft.com with &ldquo;[IE8 Community Feedback]&rdquo; in the subject line by this Friday, April 11th at Noon, PDT.</p>
<p>1) IE8 releasing in expected to release in &ldquo;standards mode&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(a) What do people in your communities space think about this decision?</p>
<p>(b) What do you predict the impact to be on the customer and/or Developer experience?</p>
<p>(c) Do you have a recommendations on how best to share this information?</p>
<p>2) Our current plan is to communicate this heavily with web site owners and developers. We will be contacting top sites directly, distributing developer FAQs, and writing Knowledge Base articles on authoring to these standards.</p>
<p>(a) Do you think that will be effective at improving the customer experience?</p>
<p>(b) Are there other suggestions do you could offer to transition web sites to be standards-based or to improve the experience for users?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Adobe is removing restrictions about how the specifications on the FLV [Flash Video] and SWF [Flash Application] files can be used, and we&#8217;re removing royalties on using Flash Player on mobile devices. We&#8217;re also publishing the FlashCast protocol as well as the device porting layer APIs for Flash Player. That will allow people to port Flash Player to a wider range of mobile devices, and also to create a Flash player from scratch, based on the Adobe specifications for the file formats.</p>
<p>Adobe will continue to try to not let the market fragment by providing the best Flash Player there is. We will continue to provide Flash Player across all the major operating systems, and try to make that the best player on each platform so people continue to adopt that one. But now anyone is free to build their own Flash Player.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;m buying my tickets to Ice Cap Hades today!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems I had written out some silly stuff using the WordPress web UI in the last few months. I typically post from MarsEdit, a great weblog post editor, by the same developer as my favorite feed reader, NetNewsWire. I guess I entered the posts, got distracted, and forgot about them after some days. They don&#8217;t show up in my drafts folder in MarsEdit. So I only saw them now that I came to admin the weblog, clean out the Akismet spam, reorganize my catetories, etc.</p>
<p>The &#8220;content&#8221;, as it was, wasn&#8217;t all that important, so no harm done. Anyhow, they&#8217;ve been pushed out to the blog, whereabouts when I think I entered them in.</p>

<p>Ken wonders why, when his blog posts are quoted by other bloggers, the quoting posts don&#8217;t show on his blog as trackbacks. But when he quotes someone, his quoting posts show up on other people&#8217;s blogs as trackbacks. Weird.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I see you hitting my RSS feed with your aggregators, friends, all four of you. There&#8217;s one Windows FeedDemon user, one Linux Firefox LiveBookmarks user, and two Mac NetNewsWire users. I call you friends because I think maybe I know you, or maybe you know me, from out there in the interwebs. I see you in my logs daily, each of you coming in from your respective IP address, day in and day out, week after week, month after month.</p>
<p><font color=red><b>Update:</b> more careful inspection of the logs show 3 feed subscribers through Bloglines, and 3 subscribers through NewsGatorOnline. Welcome! I didn&#8217;t see you earlier, because Bloglines and NewsGatorOnline only hit my feed once on behalf of all of you. You got lost in the spambot noise until I looked through the logs with a fine tooth comb and a magnifying glass.</p>
<p>There is also one Google Reader user. Thanks for the feedback, dude!</font></p>
<p>There are also some regular web visitors from IBM. I can tell because of the repeat hits from a few IBM campus subdomains over the last months. Y&#8217;all started visiting since just after Rails Day 2006, which speaks volumes, by the way. Yet you&#8217;re still more difficult to profile than my other visitors (in the IP address and user agent sense of &#8220;profile.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Are you always the same few IBMers with a few different computer types on your desks, coming back every few weeks? Or are you a new set of different IBMers each time, with a different random sample of computer types? Cuz, you know, your user agent is all over the map.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re all coming from the same three or four IBM campuses, so maybe you know each other? Do you all discuss my lame posts so far?</p>
<p>But those curious details don&#8217;t really matter, do they? That&#8217;s not what&#8217;s important about you visiting.</p>
<p>Speaking to all of you readers, IBMers and non-IBMers alike: What would you like to see me post about? Why do you visit my site? What brought you here in the first place? Would you like to see more of that, or are you interested in anything else? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d really like to know.</p>
<p>Help me make this weblog worth your time. There&#8217;s a comment box below this weaving screed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is just to let you know, I&#8217;m moving PJTrix.com to another server, where I have more storage. The server PJTrix is on right now is actually owned by a friend of mine, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elecboy.com/">Ernesto Diaz</a>. He is one of my ex-employees at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.snapplatform.org">SNAP Platform</a>, and is running a <a target="_blank" href="http://erdihost.net/index2.php">web hosting and web design business</a> for the Latinamerican geek market. For the past four months, he has let me have 2 GB of space and 60 GB of bandwidth per month on his server for free. It&#8217;s served me well, but I gotta move on.</p>
<p>As PJTrix grows into hosting my open source project for Rails Day and other ideas, the domain needs more space and bandwidth. I actually own that space and bandwidth, on the server where I host my friend&#8217;s web store and my other friend&#8217;s web gallery. That server has 500 GB of bandwidth and 20 GB of space, which are currently underused.</p>
<p>So over the next few days, there will be a change of IP address, and you&#8217;ll see PJTrix updated to a new version of WordPress and a new theme.</p>
<p>See you on the flip side!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey, give me a break, will ya? I had to start the darn thing somehow!</p>
<p>Welcome to my new humble home on the web.</p>
<p>My name is PJ Cabrera a.k.a. Dread Pirate PJ. My college friends and I are great fans of The Princess Bride, so the nickname has nothing to do with pirating per se. But I’m a bit melodramatic, so I like to use it. You may contact me by email at pjcabrera AT pobox DOT com, on MSN Messenger as dreadpiratepj AT hotmail DOT com, AIM as DreadPiratePJ, Jabber and GoogleTalk as dreadpiratepj AT gmail DOT com. Only the pjcabrera AT pobox DOT com email address is checked regularly, so simply, don&#8217;t send email messages to the hotmail or gmail accounts.</p>
<p>I am a developer with over eight years of experience, developing software for internal and external use of Fortune 1000 companies. The bulk of my experience has been with Java Enterprise Edition, but I am not very particular about which tools I use for my work &#8211; other than not using those that are total crap. <img src="tp/blawgwp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I am an advocate of open source solutions for development where warranted. I am equally comfortable with GUI and web development in Java, Python, PHP, or Ruby. I could even use C# for .Net development. But if so, I am going to be advocating deploying on Linux with Mono instead of on Windows with .Net Framework. I have an allergic reaction to Perl, I have a high sensitivity to bullshit, and I can tolerate Lisp if given enough advance warning.</p>
<p>This weblog is about my life, my hobbies, my friends, my likes, and my dislikes, in no particular order or subject distribution. The entries are going to be about shows or movies I’ve seen, places I’ve visited, food I’ve eaten, and whether I liked or disliked those things. It’s also going to be about tech and gadgets, software and hardware development, open source and free culture, indie music, internet video, and other personal media.</p>
<p>And if I get a cat, I might even post pictures every Friday. <img src="tp/blawgwp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So there you go. That’s what this is all about.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it for my first post. Have a good day!</p>
