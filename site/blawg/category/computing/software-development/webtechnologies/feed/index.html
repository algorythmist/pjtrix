				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m excited to start developing a game for the LD30 game jam.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be using the Phaser HTML5 2d game development framework. I&#8217;m going to make all the work on a Chromebook Pixel using apps from the Chrome Store. I have Xubuntu installed in a Crouton environment in the Chromebook, but I&#8217;m only using that to run Tiled, because there&#8217;s no Chrome tilemap editor. I&#8217;m using Cloud9 as my text editor, and my code will be posted on Github at https://github.com/dreadpiratepj/escape-game.</p>
<p>The theme for LD30 is &#8220;Connected Worlds&#8221;. I googled the theme and two images were the most striking and inspiring to me:</p>
<p>The first image is by karu-panda on Deviantart ( http://karu-panda.deviantart.com/art/Connected-Worlds-Sunny-Side-Up-153189742 )</p>
<p><img src="tp://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/037/2/d/Connected_Worlds_Sunny_Side_Up_by_Karu_Panda.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The second image is by the architecture &amp; design team of effekt.dk ( http://www.effekt.dk/eka/ )</p>
<p><img src="tp://static.squarespace.com/static/51819b9fe4b03000ce6f03ea/t/52288fa2e4b0e8fb2cfafa12/1378389928167/0808_EKA8.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I chose to make an HTML5 2D game, so I can&#8217;t just create a Fez clone, which is what the second image suggests to me.</p>
<p>So I think I&#8217;ll make a game where the user has to switch between &#8220;warm, sunny, right side up&#8221; world and &#8220;winter, night time, upside down&#8221; world to solve a puzzle. That is way cool, as one of my favorite games is The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, which features an alternate, connected worlds motif.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ll stick to making a puzzle game rather than a Zelda clone, as I don&#8217;t have the time or the art skills to make a Zelda clone, even if I use OGA spritesheets and tilemaps.</p>
<p>Good luck to everyone else in the game jam!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just got word from my editor at Developer.com that my latest article was published yesterday.</p>
<p>The article is called &#8220;Writing Facebook Applications with Java EE&#8221; and you can find it <a href="http://www.developer.com/java/article.php/3733751">here</a>.</p>
<p>The amount of information out there on writing Facebook apps with Java is scarce, and what is out there for Java Facebook applications, is often incomplete. I hope the article helps Java Facebook developers start on the right foot.</p>
<p>It was interesting returning to work with Java, even if only for the few weekends during which I wrote this article. I hadn&#8217;t developed in Java at all in almost two years. I was surprised I hadn&#8217;t forgotten any important details.</p>
<p>I have another article for Amazon Web Services submitted and in the editing pipeline. It should be coming out in the next few weeks</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been at my new job only four weeks, and my first project is nearly finished. My task these past four weeks has been the re-implementation of the company&#8217;s website in Rails. I was to do this from scratch, while keeping the site&#8217;s design and existing link structure. Among my requirements is adding support for multiple languages, as the company wants to show it knows how to make websites for a diverse, multi-ethnic audience. Another requirement was, that I was to do this re-implementation by myself. The company only has one other experienced Rails developer, and he is busy doing maintenance work on older non-Rails projects for company customers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a pleasure working on this project, and I am very pleased in the progress I&#8217;ve made in such a short time. I look forward to going live in another two to three weeks, once the site has been through QA and any changes required.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This coming Wednesday, May 16, I am off to <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails">RailsConf 2007</a>, in the lovely city of Portland, Oregon. Portland is great, I have been there twice and I&#8217;ve had a great time each trip. I look forward to the visit very much.</p>
<p>Two of my coworkers from the <a href="http://www.attwilliams.com">Williams F1</a> project, <a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/7888-kyle-drake">Kyle Drake</a> and <a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/5387-nicholas-wright">Nick Wright</a>, are going to be attending RailsConf as well. It&#8217;s gonna be great to meet them face-to-face. <a href="http://www.endpoint.com/page/bio/Daniel_Browning">Daniel Browning</a>, one of my fellow coworkers at my new job, lives just north of Portland.  My college buddy Ken Williams lives in the Portland area too. I plan to meet with them at some time during this, my third visit to Portland.</p>
<p>There are so many sessions I want to attend at RailsConf. But interestingly enough, I feel I won&#8217;t get any value out of the tutorial sessions, so I didn&#8217;t sign up for any of them. That means I&#8217;m out of the tutorial-attending n00b league, yeah! <img src="tp/blawgwp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We&#8217;ll see whether I can hang on to that thought in the other, more advanced sessions. <img src="tp://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>A few of the sessions sound downright dull. I guess some of the n00bs will find them interesting, since they&#8217;re looking for &#8216;insight&#8217; and whatnot. Whatever. <img src="tp://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>What am I looking for from RailsConf? I&#8217;m looking for some nitty-gritty I can sink my teeth into, some new tech I can experiment with and learn more from. I&#8217;m looking forward to have my brain blown by something cool but complicated that I can learn over the next few months. I want to learn about some new-to-me techniques and plugins or gems that I can master and take my Ruby and Rails to a higher level.</p>
<p>I also look forward to meeting some people face to face. Tim Bray is going to be delivering the keynote on Saturday morning. If you&#8217;ve been reading my blog for the last year, you already know what I think of him: he&#8217;s the d00d!</p>
<p>The JRuby guys will be presenting one session, and I think their work is of importance for the growth of Rails outside the leading edge. I think JRuby will be the thing to help Rails cross the chasm and be adopted by mainstream.</p>
<p>At OSCON 2005, DHH signed my Agile Web Development With Rails 1st Edition, so I will try to get Robert Martin, Dave Thomas, and Andy Hunt to sign some of my other books that they wrote.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ll talk to you all later!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Wednesday, I sent emails and r&eacute;sum&eacute;s for various job posts, and by that afternoon, I started getting nibbles. It was weird! Whereas I barely got any attention for over a dozen job applications I sent out between September and early February, I suddenly had five companies interested in me in a matter of hours! Maybe companies were waiting for post-holiday economy reports to start hiring? I wonder.</p>
<p>So to cut to the chase, I got a great hourly-pay remote development gig working on a Ruby on Rails project, on a really cool sounding website, for a very-high-profile vehicle racing company in the UK. <a href="http://www.quietvoice.org/index.php/2007/02/18/daytona-500-pre-race-hype/">It&#8217;s right down Ken&#8217;s alley</a>, but if I&#8217;m not mistaken, this sport usually has a definitely more European racing audience. I think American racing fans like Ken, might resent these are not American cars, and just don&#8217;t watch. LOL</p>
<p>I cannot disclose any more information because of client confidentiality, but I think I may already have said too much. :-p</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post a link here when the site goes up, at any rate. Only then can we drop all this silly NDA crap. It&#8217;s a bummer, because I can&#8217;t discuss application architecture specifics that would be of interest to my readers.</p>
<p>But fret not. There&#8217;s no rule about my discussing the project&#8217;s architecture in general. I just can&#8217;t say right out what architecture I&#8217;m dealing with on this gig.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be writing more about Rails in the weeks ahead, but just cuz I write about it, don&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s got a thing to do with work, you hear? :: rolls eyes ::</p>
