				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I receive some mailings from Sun every month. And for the most part, they are entertaining. As in laugh out loud hysterical. But this one takes the cake.</p>
<p><cite><br />
Easier, faster, and more secure the Solaris 10 OS is the only operating system robust enough to address enterprise security, compliance, and business continuity concerns, and at a lower cost and running across more hardware platforms than any other OS on the market.<br />
</cite></p>
<p>Excuse me, but &#8220;more hardware platforms than any other OS on the market?&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what Sun&#8217;s definition of platform is, but last I checked, Solaris didn&#8217;t run on HP PA-RISC and IBM S/390s. Linux does, though. Linux runs on all three platforms that Solaris runs on <i>**snort, yeah they&#8217;re beating their chest over three platforms**</i> <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/">and then some</a>. And I bet that when they say &#8220;OS on the market,&#8221; they mean commercially supported OS. Which conveniently disqualifies <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/#in-tree-ports">NetBSD, which is available for over forty platforms</a>.</p>
<p><cite><br />
Hear from Sun&#8217;s Vice President of Software Marketing, Peder Ulander, and Vice President of Services Marketing, Brian Winter about how Sun&#8217;s Solaris 10 Operating System &mdash; the only multiplatform, free, and open source enterprise-class OS on the market &mdash; allows you to leverage existing infrastructure investments and anticipate rapid growth by bringing applications and services online more quickly, and at lower support costs, than any other commercial OS offering, including Red Hat, HP-UX, AIX, and Windows.<br />
</cite></p>
<p>Whoa, Nelly! &#8220;The only multiplatform, free, and open source enterprise-class OS on the market&#8221;. That&#8217;s likely to get you thrown in court in most free countries, never mind hanged in those run by Sharia law! I&#8217;m not saying that Solaris isn&#8217;t free, or that it isn&#8217;t open source, or that it isn&#8217;t multi-platform. I guess 3 platforms does count as multi-platform.</p>
<p>But my beef is with &#8220;only&#8221;. Say what?!? Are you so desperate, Sun Microsystems, that you have to resort to outright lies? No outgoing links on this post for you, Sun!</p>
<p>For the record, I do like Solaris. It&#8217;s false claims like these from Sun which I despise.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the months ahead, I will be making use of this weblog to discuss software development technologies and processes I&#8217;ve learned to use in my ten-year career. I will most likely be writing about web technologies and web services, and open source technologies rather than proprietary ones.</p>
<p>I am more likely to cover <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby as a language and cross-platform development technology</a> versus other open source technologies, as this is what I now prefer. But you may also see posts on C and C++, Java Enterprise Edition technologies, Python, Mozilla technologies such as <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XUL">XUL</a> and <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner">XULRunner</a>, and software development ideas in general. I may cover C# and .Net, but only because you can develop cross-platform applications with them using <a href="http://mono-project.com/">Mono</a>.</p>
<p>My article proposals for &#8220;the secret online geekly articles site&#8221; are most likely to be accepted if they are about Java technologies. As I research my articles, I am bound to write about Java subjects here. But I&#8217;ll try to make the weblog posts more general than the articles. If the article proposals get turned down after a few rewritings and retries, I will publish the subject here or try to get them published somewhere else, like <a href="http://www.infoq.com">InfoQ</a> and <a href="http://www.theserverside.com">The Server Side.com</a>. (BTW, that should be a hint that those two sites aren&#8217;t &#8220;the secret online geekly articles site.&#8221;)</p>
<p>I will also cover some Unix administration topics. For example, I feel I ought to cover the details of pjtrix&#8217;s Subversion configuration, as I found the <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">online manual</a> a bit wanting in specifics. Other like-minded geeks, the very people I&#8217;d like to bring to my weblog, might welcome a more direct approach. There are also more ssh tricks I haven&#8217;t begun to cover.</p>
<p>All of this writing will hopefully be bringing new readers to my humble weblog and other parts of the website. Armed with this hope, I continue to get pjtrix.com ready for 2007.</p>
<p>Tuesday night, I signed up to Google Analytics and Tools for Webmasters, and added to the WordPress and Trac templates the bits of JavaScript that report to Google where you all come from. The reports Google provides are nice and pretty, but I find Google&#8217;s solution wanting, specially in their support of blogging and citizen media. The tools are more geared towards &#8220;website&#8221; traffic analysis. That&#8217;s just lame.</p>
<p>Not everyone that will come here will do so with a JavaScript-powered browser. Feed readers and podcast clients, for instance, only speak HTTP and RSS or Atom. They will leave no trace in Google Analytics&#8217; logs.</p>
<p>To complement Google Analytics, I&#8217;ve installed the <a href="http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/">Webalizer Apache log analysis tool</a>, which will help me study my web server logs in more detail without my being swamped in hundreds of megabytes of raw text.</p>
<p>I also installed the <a href="http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress">Popularity Contest</a> WordPress plugin. This should help direct search-passers-by to what&#8217;s hot on this site, or just make it more clear sooner that they got to the wrong place. <img src="tp/blawgwp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Hopefully, the combination of Google Analytics, Webalizer, and Popularity Contest, will together help me learn who my audience is, learn what is &#8220;my voice,&#8221; and learn how to make this weblog more valuable to my readers.</p>
