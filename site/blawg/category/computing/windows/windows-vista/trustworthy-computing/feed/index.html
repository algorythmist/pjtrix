				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hadn&#8217;t realized so much time had passed since my last post. Mea culpa, I haven&#8217;t made time for new content. I&#8217;d been working my butt off and hanging out in Guild Wars to relax. <img src="tp/blawgwp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> My apologies to my faithful and adoring readership (all four of you!)</p>
<p>I upgraded WordPress to version 2.0.5 just before I started this post. It was another textbook example of a successful upgrade.</p>
<p>Speaking of seamless and successful updates, I really can&#8217;t say the same about Microsoft&#8217;s upgrade to IE. IE7 has only been out two weeks, and <a title="Microsoft's new browser haunted by old flaw" target="_blank" href="http://security.itworld.com/5043/061030msflaw/page_1.html">it already suffers from a bug from the early IE6 days.</a></p>
<p>I would be willing to cut MS some slack if this was a new flaw. As a developer, I know that bugs happen. No one writes perfect code. But this is an old bug, and no developer worthy of the appelation &#8220;world-class&#8221; would have missed it. There&#8217;s no reason a &#8220;world-class&#8221; QA department should have missed it either.</p>
<p>If this is indicative of the <a target="_blank" title="Computing you can count on? Yeah, right" href="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/execmail/2002/07-18twc.mspx">Trustworthy Computing</a> initiative that allegedly started with the development of Windows Server 2003, then I really, really wonder why anybody will bother to get Vista for anything but the computer games. I mean, that&#8217;s all Windows is good for, isn&#8217;t it? Oh yeah, I forgot. It&#8217;s great for spreading spam bots, too.</p>
<p>This IE7 bug simply proves there is no guarantee, no matter what monkey boy Ballmer and goodie-two-shoes Gates say, that IE7 and Vista won&#8217;t bite your ass with the same bugs that plagued IE and Windows for the last half decade.</p>
<p>For the guys up there in Redmond, here&#8217;s a freebie development mentoring lesson you have apparently not being taught by your &#8220;visionary leader&#8221;: regression test.</p>
<p>Trustworthy computing, my ass.</p>
