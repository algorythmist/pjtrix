				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I enjoy Tim Bray&#8217;s writing at <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">his weblog, titled Ongoing</a>. I began reading in late 2001, and I was hooked by his digital photography, his excellent writing, and his deep analysis of technical and cultural trends. His series on <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/13/Multicore">multi-core</a>, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/06/12/Threads">multi-threaded</a>, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/20/Threads">parallelism</a> is required reading for any self-respecting 21st century enterprise-level software architect, which I am. (OK, OK, I admit I&#8217;m also quite the geek, having learned Intel 8008 machine language at the age of 7. As of February 2006, I&#8217;m 35, and I still <strong><em>luuuv</em></strong> this kind of deep hardware detail.)</p>
<p>And Tim&#8217;s weblog platform fascinates me. Instead of using Movable Type, or WordPress, or Bloxsom, etc., he has implemented his own weblog engine, using what he claims is <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Colophon">a 2200-line Perl script, a MySQL metadata back end, and a little XML</a>.</p>
<p>His weblog engine features a webpage template with a rotating image header, and a sidebar with a rotating random image from his substantial digital photography collection. This past week, he says he fixed a problem he had with the sidebar image, adding<br />
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/07/Thumbnail">a bit of AJAXy goodness or other to his sidebar</a>. Not the least bit surprisingly from Tim, the entry goes into more than a bit of detail about how his weblog engine is put together, and what he has done to fix the sidebar image issue. And it is awesome! Tim is definitely an &uuml;ber-h4x0r.</p>
<p>You see, the weblog runtime is entirely filesystem-based! Unlike WordPress, Typo, Bloxsom, and other weblog engines, he doesn&#8217;t use a runtime database and templating engine, and does not bother with much dynamic HTML generation for each weblog entry requested by a visitor. His weblog platform <em>is</em> automated, in the sense that he doesn&#8217;t write the pages from scratch all in HTML, natch. He has a Perl-script generate the website content from XML-based templates, and the entries are written with pseudo-HTML style tags.</p>
<p>Having the content be generated and stored on the filesystem means two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>His weblog is very robust under stress, since there are no, um, &#8220;moving,&#8221; software parts besides the OS, a filesystem, and Apache.</li>
<li>Even on a modest server, it should withstand a whole lot of slashdotting (or is it diggs that we have to worry about now?).</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to admit, I am more than a little bit jealous. Being a hopeless geek myself since an early age, I&#8217;ve always been fascinated with the inner workings of computers and software. And my mind wants to grok how things work, and I enjoy making my own things.</p>
<p>Now I too want a filesystem-based weblog engine to call my own! I too want a weblog with spiffy graphical headers, and AJAX goodness, and metadata. Really, what geek doesn&#8217;t enjoy goofing around with a little metadata? <img src="tp/blawgwp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It will all be put together and crafted by my own mental powers and some clever typing in some clever little language.</p>
<p>So starting this week, using my copious free time, I am going to write my own simple filesystem-based weblog engine. Details to come as I get my butt in gear.</p>
