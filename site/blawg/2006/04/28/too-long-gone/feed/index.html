		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ken,

I too used my PowerBook as a desktop most of the time. It was only truly a laptop when I used to have a commute to work, or when I travelled to a conference.

And yes, the &quot;Hacks and Tricks&quot; have been missing. I have to write up a hack to post real soon. My credibility as a tech blogger rides on it! :-D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Welcome back, Dude!  I knew you were still around, from the occasional Cabrera-lanche in the comments at Daves place and mine. :)

I run my Powerbook more like a desktop, but mine still suffers from sleep disorders.  

Looking forward to &quot;Hacks and Tricks&quot; coming from here...

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Mark! The santeria priest would have been appreciated, I am in a real funk without my Mac!

As for the babies comment, I got a doozie for you: 

every morning, I wake up, walk over to the Windows laptop to check email while the coffee brews, and I get all nauseus, with something like morning sickness. ;-)]]></description>
