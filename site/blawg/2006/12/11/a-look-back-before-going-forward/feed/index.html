I should have the first of many web technologies posts coming out over the next few days. I&#039;ll try to bring everyone up to speed as we go along. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Season&#039;s Greetings, PJ.  It takes guts to strike out on one&#039;s own.  You&#039;ve made it nearly a year, which is a milestone for independents and small business.

Sometimes financial lessons are best learned via SHK (The School of Hard Knocks). ;)  Sounds like you&#039;ve graduated.  

Good look in landing a new situation; I&#039;m looking forward to whatever you have to say about web technologies; that&#039;s an area I know next to nothing about.  I can&#039;t even spell the acronyms :)

Best wishes for Christmas, and a blessed and successful 2007.
