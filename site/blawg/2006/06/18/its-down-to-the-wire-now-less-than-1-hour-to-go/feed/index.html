		<description><![CDATA[Actually, now that I think about it, my server has plenty of unused bandwidth (500 GB/month.) And I&#039;ve always wanted to learn how to set up a public Subversion server with proper write-access control.

So I think, from now on, I&#039;ll host my own open source projects, instead of putting them up on rubyforge or sourceforge.

Also it is in keeping with the original vision for the site as a source of hacks and tricks. Which I&#039;ll get to in a second. :-)]]></description>
