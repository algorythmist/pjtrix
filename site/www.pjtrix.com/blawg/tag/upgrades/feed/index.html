				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So today I updated WordPress to 2.6.5. And like every other time, it was a cinch, all over and done in less than five minutes. Thanks, WordPress guys!</p>
<p>In other news, I have been geeking out with both the iPhone SDK and the Android SDK, and I believe I have a little something special going here. I hope to have it ready for release, on both platforms, sometime in January. Development continues.</p>
<p>I will need beta testers soon. Any T-Mobile G1 users interested in helping out, you can email me at dreadpiratepj [at] gmail [dot] com</p>
<p>Speaking of Android, I started playing with it now that the source code to the whole thing has been released. I managed to get Android booting on a Palm TX, but it still needs a lot of work. It boots, but it doesn&#8217;t do crap once it boots. <img src="http://www.pjtrix.com/blawg/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I get all the way to the &#8220;Press the MENU key to unlock&#8221; screen, but none of the keys do anything. Neither does touching the screen. It&#8217;s an issue with the Linux kernel drivers and device configuration. It just wasn&#8217;t made to run on a Palm TX without proper tweaking of the source. I just don&#8217;t know what the proper tweaking is.</p>
<p>I need to look in my bag of loot for a Palm serial cable (I&#8217;m sure I have one somewhere) and hopefully I can get a serial console from which to poke around inside Android.</p>
<p>I do have Android running successfully on my Sprint Touch (my parents, my sister and I have a family plan on Sprint.) Credit for that goes to <a href="http://it029000.massey.ac.nz/vogue">Dr. Martin Johnson in New Zeland</a>. I just use his release on my phone (before you ask, no, his release doesn&#8217;t work on the Palm TX. It&#8217;s the first thing I tried. <img src="http://www.pjtrix.com/blawg/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When WordPress 2.5 was announced, I decided to stay on 2.3.x for a while. I finally upgraded to 2.5.1, and I&#8217;m glad. My Bad Behavior plugin was outdated, and WP offered to upgrade for me. It happened without a glitch. From reading the upgrade information, it seems that when 2.5.2 comes out, I&#8217;ll be able to update by just clicking a self-update button on the administrative interface.</p>
<p>The new WordPress administrative interface is a lot less cluttered, and more useful information is shown on the main page. The look is cleaner while remaining usable. It looks like a lot of time and effort was spent improving it.</p>
<p>Rather than tip my hat at the WordPress folks one more time (it&#8217;s getting old to do that every few months) I&#8217;m just going to give them Dread Pirate PJ&#8217;s Hoard of Loot lifetime award.</p>

Over on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/">WordPress Development Blog</a>, they&#8217;re pimping the upcoming WordPress 2.5 and the release candidates process before final release, and it sounds awesome. It includes a boatload of new features, but my favorite has got to be one-click plugin upgrades.</p>
<p>Upgrading WordPress itself is fairly easy, but upgrading your plugins can be an annoying manual process. You have to disable the plugin on the admin dashboard, download the new version, move the old files out of the way and put the new ones in place, then re-enable the plugin on the dashboard. You typically do this one plugin at a time, to check for problems and rollback as needed. Take my word, it&#8217;s annoying doing this for more than two plugins at a time, even though it is still a fairly easy process.</p>
<p>In 2.5, the WordPress developers have now made plugin updates as easy as in desktop applications like Firefox. That makes the whole management of the weblog much easier and more hassle-free than it ever was.</p>
<p>I am probably going to wait a few weeks once 2.5 is out, to let any bugs and issues shake out. But it sounds like a really worthwhile upgrade. I&#8217;m really glad to run WordPress here. Hats off once again to the WordPress developers.
