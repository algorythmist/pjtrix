		<description><![CDATA[Hi Pete,

The code you write to program with the open source toolchain is exactly the same as with the official SDK, as long as you use the SDK  headers, frameworks and libraries. You should be able to get started with a Windows or Linux computer and a jailbroken device.

I&#039;ll argue that going this route will make you a better iPhone developer, because you&#039;ll learn how to program your UI from scratch, instead of being spoiled by Interface Builder. ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been toying with the idea of trying out iPhone dev for a while now, and my question is this:

if I start a project using the open source SDk, how easy is it to transfer it to the official SDK, should I decide to do so? Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have tried hard to use gcc4.2 to build the toolchain, and i did follow the instruction of saurik http://www.saurik.com/id/4

but, unfortunately i failed. Contacting with saurik, he just told me that the toolchain will work, but don&#039;t tell me how to make it work. i feel sad, and i am really disappointed because he didn reply my Email anymore]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, I had someone write to me in the last few days that the toolchain does not work with 3.0. I&#039;m looking into it but don&#039;t have a timeframe. Will get to it when I can. My hunch is that 3.0 uses GCC 4.2 and this toolchain is GCC 4.0, but it&#039;s just a hunch.]]></description>

Try the 1.2 SDK headers.

svn co http://iphone-dev.googlecode.com/svn/branches/include-1.2-sdk

Sorry for the confusion. It&#039;s been a while since I wrote that HelloWorld example. Notice in the comment header that it&#039;s dated August 2008.]]></description>

and looking at the publishing date 2009-7
oh, i have to ask a question. will this work for IPHONE3.0?
i really need a workable toolchain for 3.0]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Managed to get the Mac OX X 10.4 SDK installed using the iPhone-dev instructions plus your ./configure &amp; sudo steps. 

However, that placed all the relevant headers in /usr/local/arm-apple-darwin/include instead of /usr/local/iphone-sysroot/usr/include

So I copied ..darwin/include/* to iphone-sysroot/usr/include

Now your HelloWorldiPhone example has a lot less compile errors, but I still get:

HelloWorld.m:15: error: too many arguments to function &#039;UIApplicationMain&#039;

I wonder if your toolchain download and the iPhone-dev team&#039;s header files are incompatible?

thanks again!

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Luis, thanks for stopping by!

It seems I forgot a step in using the iPhone-dev team&#039;s header files. You need to provide the location to the Mac OS X 10.4 SDK (the 10.4 SDK that comes with plain XCode 3.1 should be fine). I&#039;ve amended the blog post with the details.

On the other hard, if you&#039;re going to go through the trouble of obtaining 10.4 SDK files, you may as well just get the official SDK files.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great info!!! Thanks!!!

I&#039;ve downloaded everything and gave &#039;make&#039; a try (on a linux (Ubuntu) sstem).   I got the include files from the iPhone-dev team SVN repository, but it seems that there are some files missing (or at least not corresponding to your sample code). 

Here are the first few compilation errors:

 /usr/local/bin/arm-apple-darwin9-gcc -c -I/usr/local/lib/gcc/arm-apple-darwin9/4.2.1/include -isysroot /usr/local/iphone-sysroot  HelloWorld.m -o HelloWorld.o            
  HelloWorld.m:9:34: error: Foundation/Foundation.h: No such file or directory                                                                                              
  In file included from HelloWorld.m:10:                                                                                                                                    
  /usr/local/iphone-sysroot/usr/include/UIKit/UIKit.h:3:38: error: CoreGraphics/CoreGraphics.h: No such file or directory                                                   
  /usr/local/iphone-sysroot/usr/include/UIKit/UIKit.h:4:42: error: CoreFoundation/CoreFoundation.h: No such file or directory         

I don&#039;t have a Foundation directory in iphone-sysroot/usr/include,  nor a CoreGraphics.

I suppose I should try getting the includes from the SDK directly?

Thanks for all this!!!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Lucas,

What did you use to unpack the toolchain on Windows? I&#039;m afraid WinZip and WinRAR don&#039;t support symlinks. Try from the cygwin command line:

cd /

tar xzf /path/to/toolchain.tgz]]></description>
