		<description><![CDATA[Ken,

Thanks for the suggestion! I will keep that in mind in the future.

I&#039;m trying to keep hacks in 2007 as relevant, short and sweet as possible (as opposed to the previous SSH hack in 2006, which rambed quite a lot.) But including a few links at the end won&#039;t hurt.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very cool.  I&#039;ve used screen a little before, but autossh is a new one for me.   One suggestion: when you feature things like these, it would be nice to have download links to the packages you mention. I know we can all use &quot;The Google&quot;, but one of a SysAdmin&#039;s required attributes is laziness.  At least, for me. :)
