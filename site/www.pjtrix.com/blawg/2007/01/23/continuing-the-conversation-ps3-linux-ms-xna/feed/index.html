Porting XNA games to Mono.XNA will be easy but not automatic - there are several problems with automatic conversion between DirectX and OpenGL standards.

btw. I really like XNA and I&#039;m developing few simple games using XNA ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LOL, alright Lenny. If it&#039;s technology related, I guess it&#039;s OK. :-D

My BitTorrent download of Heroes episode 12, has 58 minutes to go before I can watch. I started it about 10 hours ago, while having breakfast!]]></description>
