				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, I got about 50% of my planned features done. I&#8217;ll just keep correcting the layout till ten minutes to midnight, check in the last changes, and them I&#8217;m gonna crash till about noon tomorrow. My dad&#8217;s Father&#8217;s Day party is at 1 p.m.</p>
<p>On Monday, I&#8217;ll deploy my Rails Day entry on my server. So you can all laugh and point fingers at my naive web design. I never claimed to be a web designer, I am a developer. It&#8217;s not the same thing. I don&#8217;t have the graphical talent needed for web design, whereas development is mostly about logic. Right brain vs. left brain, and I don&#8217;t have the right brain for it (pun not intended, I swear!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post a post-mortem later: why I didn&#8217;t finish, what held me up the most, what was simplest.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; Happy Father&#8217;s Day, Ken, and my other &#8220;childrened&#8221; readers. <img src="http://www.pjtrix.com/blawg/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t look like I&#8217;ll get 70% of the functionality in by midnight. It may be more like 50%. I&#8217;ll keep on truckin&#8217;, no sense quiting now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My stomach started hurting about 10 minutes ago. It could be from the coffee I had a few hours ago. But I think it&#8217;s just gastric juices from 10-11 hours without a meal (and that&#8217;s a guess. I don&#8217;t remember if I had dinner at 6, 7, or 8 last night.)</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m going to have breakfast. I&#8217;m doing good with the wakey wakey, so I&#8217;ll lay off the coffee for now. Save it for when I <b><i>really</i></b> need it.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; Preliminary functional tests for conversations are done. Now I just need to tailor them for typical webmail actions. Then I move on to implementing said actions, and adding unit tests for conversations and emails.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; &#8230; and miles to go before I sleep.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My webmail app for <a href="http://www.railsday2006.com">Rails Day 2006</a> has the all-popular tagging capability (i.e. what GMail calls &#8220;labels&#8221;.) In the spirit of agile development, Rails has a plugin called acts_as_taggable, that lets developers add tagging to their applications without a whole lot of work.</p>
<p>At least that&#8217;s the theory.</p>
<p>A webmail app has many users, so it is important for taggings to be <b><i>per user</i></b>. And the Rails community has published how-tos on the web to solve this issue, and it is easy to add user relationships to taggings.</p>
<p>Except the plugin comes with no tests! I don&#8217;t even have tests to modify and fix to reflect my code changes.</p>
<p>One positive note: no tests means, the test framework has nothing to fail on. LOL!</p>

<p>I got little more than nineteen hours to go. Hopefully I can make up the time lost. I&#8217;ll be happy if I can get basic webmail functionality done within that time. Let&#8217;s see what the judges think of that. <img src="http://www.pjtrix.com/blawg/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In just over three hours, I will be competing in <a href="http://www.railsday2006.com/">Rails Day 2006</a>. It&#8217;s a coding competition, where you are only allowed to use Ruby on Rails to create a full web app in 24 hours.</p>
<p>I have a thermos full of hot coffee, with milk and sweetener already added &#8211; can&#8217;t waste time on the little stuff! <img src="http://www.pjtrix.com/blawg/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I also have juice, water, and ready-to-eat snacks and food in the fridge (choc chip cookies, Subway salads and subs, and leftovers from yesterday.)</p>
<p>As (bad? good?) luck would have it, my customer was short on funds this week. So I didn&#8217;t have work, but therefore had the whole week to get ready for Rails Day. I&#8217;ve been practicing by writing lots of small apps, learning to use more of Rails and the various plugins available.</p>
<p>I am competing just to see what I&#8217;ve learned in the last year. Whatever problems I encounter will be an indication of what I need to concentrate on in my self-education in the months ahead. Hopefully I&#8217;ll do a good enough job to win a prize or two, and I&#8217;ll work my butt of to achieve that.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome, I also thought I could document how I made my web app in a series of screencasts/vidcasts. I&#8217;m going to be sans work for a few weeks until my customer can get some revenue (two of their customers didn&#8217;t pay them in May, so they are short on funds. If things don&#8217;t change by July 1st, it&#8217;s sayonara Rails project in PR, hello USA traveling consultant.) So I actually will have time to make a few vidcasts about how I implement my app.</p>
<p>Either way, win or lose, this is going to get me some exposure. I doubt I&#8217;ll get everything I have planned implemented in 24 hours. But I believe I can get 70% done in that time. After Rails Day, I&#8217;ll keep working on and improving the app, whether I win anything or not. I&#8217;m writing something I&#8217;ve wanted to see implemented since as far as I&#8217;ve used email, oh 20-odd years ago. Oh yeah, it&#8217;s an email app. You&#8217;ll see. <img src="http://www.pjtrix.com/blawg/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna catch a few winks, and then I&#8217;ll get up at 11 p.m. to get my source code repository credentials. Talk to you all later.</p>
