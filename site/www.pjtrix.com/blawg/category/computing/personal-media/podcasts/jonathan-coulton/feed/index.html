				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just noticed my weekly $1 USD donation to Jonathan Coulton&#8217;s Thing A Week has been cancelled. I pay attention to all my Paypal notifications, 1) to catch any phishing attempts, 2) to make sure I really did buy what Paypal says I bought. I was surprised the weekly donation was cancelled by Jonathan himself and not by Paypal because of lack of funds or whatever.</p>
<p>I checked his site, and everything is alright. He is still putting new blog content out, and the Thing A Week podcast had a new song and all. Hmm, maybe I&#8217;m supposed to signup to the weekly donation again? Maybe I&#8217;m making a big deal out of nothing?</p>
<p>PS &#8211; This was in my drafts folder for a few days. I just noticed and published it. But it&#8217;s now moot, Jonathan and Thing A Week are doing fine.</p>
