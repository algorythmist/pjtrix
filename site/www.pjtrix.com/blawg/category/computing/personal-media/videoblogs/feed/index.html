				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s cut to the chase: the iPhone is the most innovative communications and media device of the 21st century&#8217;s first decade. The other devices and manufacturers don&#8217;t even come close. Before the iPhone, you could think the competing devices had evolutionary interfaces, a step up from the previous interface. Now, you can&#8217;t help but think them mediocre in comparison to the iPhone. The user interface is the iPhone&#8217;s forte, followed by the convergence of widescreen media player, full featured web browser, PIM, and cell phone into one device. Is my opinion clear enough? <img src="http://www.pjtrix.com/blawg/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>All that being said, the iPhone is not ideal, nor flawless. The PIM features are, in my opinion, incomplete. I am referring to the fact that you can&#8217;t enter new data into the Notes, Contacts or Calendar apps, except by syncing the device to a Mac running Stickies, iCal and Apple Address Book. I hope Apple starts to see the potential market this has with more PIM features. Maybe they were pressed for release, and cut the features out for now to add them later. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see on that.</p>
<p>Apple could also open the device for third party development. According to Apple, it&#8217;s just Mac OS X Tiger inside. Perhaps someone will figure out how to hack Safari to download Mac OS X apps on to it. Or at least let us install Dashboard widgets on the thing.</p>
<p>But this being an Apple product whose name begins with I and P, it is a great media player. <a href="http://podstar.homestarrunner.com/">Strong Bad Emails</a>, <a href="http://askaninja.com/">Ask A Ninja</a>, and <a href="http://www.tikibartv.com">Tiki Bar TV</a> rule! They&#8217;re my favorite videoblogs. <a href="http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/wordpress">Evil Genius Chronicles</a>, <a href="www.coverville.com">Coverville</a>, <a href="http://www.bfbs2.com/rnb.html">Raven n Blues</a>, and <a href="http://www.bandanablues.com/">Bandana Blues</a>, are among my favorite podcasts. Since the iPhone is essentially a phone with 8GB video iPod features, we&#8217;ll be able to access all our new media on it, with a better interface than anyone has ever produced. I predict Apple will bring the iPhone UI (without the phone features) to the rest of the iPod family within the year. They&#8217;ll be stupid not to. MultiTouch rocks!</p>
<p>Of course, the iPhone&#8217;s price has to come down for it to be really mainstream. I predict (you heard it here first, folks, LOL) that next year, the 8GB model will be the low end, and a higher capacity (16GB?) model will be the $600 high end.</p>
<p>In order for the iPhone to be really successful and mainstream, it should also be sold unlocked, free of carrier lock-in. Not everyone wants to be Cingular subscriber. The whole carrier lock-in thing is bone headed anyway. It surely has been demonstrated in Europe that expensive carrier-exclusive phones are not necessary to retain customers. And the practice isn&#8217;t that effective for that purpose either anyway. Carrier chickenshits, if you ain&#8217;t got good service, an expensive locked-in phone won&#8217;t help you keep any subscribers you&#8217;ve pissed off. They&#8217;ll just sell it on eBay and move on.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the iPhone is a great innovative cellphone/media player with some PIM functionality. The crux of its innovation rests on the MultiTouch touchscreen interface and wide screen media playback. It has a few flaws, namely the lack of smartphone PIM features and a closed development model. To really hit it big, it has to come down in price a bit, and be available at more than one carrier in the US. In any case, Apple has essentially raised the bar way up in the user interface front, making the competition look ancient in comparison.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
I have been listening to podcasts and watching videoblogs since September 2004. As the first podcasts and videoblogs improved the value in their content, I started to see a trend in myself. I stopped listening to the radio. I stopped channel surfing in front of the boob tube. I became a lot more discriminating in what I chose to spend my time listening to or watching.</p>
<p>But my tastes were not changing. I was simply choosing to only watch and listen to that which was within my tastes. I now see TV and radio channel surfing as wasting my time looking for mainstream media to put something on that I might like. Instead, I pick out podcasts and videoblogs with content I really care about, TiVo or download those TV shows I know I enjoy, and spend my time consuming that. And best of all, I don&#8217;t have to fast-forward through commercials.</p>
<p>This has resulted in my gaining several hours in my week, which were previously spent bored to death flipping channels. And by moving my pre-selected video watching to the weekend, my weeknights are now totally open. I now have more time for friends and family.</p>
<p>Every two to three months, I switch on the car radio to see if there&#8217;s anything new, but I find the exact same songs as two or three months ago! Even the radio commercials haven&#8217;t changed! Meanwhile, I get a dozen different artists&#8217; songs in a single day from <a href="http://indiefeed.com">Indiefeed</a> and <a href="http://www.music4ipods.com">Music 4 iPods</a>, with no annoying, repetitive, boring, commercials. It&#8217;s not that the commercials on Indiefeed and Music 4 iPods are better. These podcasts have no commercials at all. <font color=red><b>Update:</b> I am not against commercials in personal media, I&#8217;m just glad there are no commercials in these feeds right now. <img src="http://www.pjtrix.com/blawg/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I am more of a believer in listener support, through donations, of the podcasts I really enjoy.</font></p>
<p>I am not the only one that is noticing this change in how we increasingly engage with media. Established radio and TV producers that have turned to podcasters and videobloggers themselves have noticed, that the people that watch and listen to their online productions &#8220;talk back&#8221; a lot more than mainstream media consumers used to.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.daveraven.co.uk/">Dave Raven</a>, of <a href="http://www.ssvc.com/bfbs/radio/radio2/">BFBS Radio 2</a>, has been in mainstream radio for many decades. He produces and hosts a one hour blues radio program that is broadcast weekly in the UK, <a href="http://www.bfbs2.com/rnb.html">Raven &#8216;n&#8217; the Blues (RnB)</a>.  He started podcasting RnB in late 2004. He has noticed that he has a more engaging audience in the podcast listeners, than in the millions he ostensibly reaches through the radio waves.</p>
<p>There already is a large number of podcasts and videoblogs out there, and the growth doesn&#8217;t seem to be abating. There is clearly a market for personal media. Personal media not only challenges, but improves on what the mainstream media offers. Personal media does this by either filling a niche that mainstream media choses not to fill (i.e. podcasts and videoblogs about hacking and open source software), or by doing a better job (as in the case of the indie music shows.)</p>
<p>As mainstream media continues to throw away their money on DRM and in lawsuits, trying to defend their business models, personal media will continue to grow and attract more people by being open. I find it hilarious, that in trying to defend their business, they are only marginalizing themselves in a world growing daily with more open media choices.</p>
<p>The smart producers and artists will jump ship and start producing and creating personal media before the mainstream media boat completely sinks. Those remaining will be the incompetent, lazy, and money grubbing. They will sink with the Titanic. Hopefully they&#8217;ll take with them more than a few corporate IP lawyers for good measure.</p>
<p>I say, good riddance.
