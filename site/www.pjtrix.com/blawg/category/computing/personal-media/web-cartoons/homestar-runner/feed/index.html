				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just discovered today, that <a href="http://www.tmbg.com">They Might Be Giants</a> has a <a href="http://www.tmbg.com/pod.html">podcast</a>! I&#8217;m way late in discovering this, as the first episode was from the summer of 2005. They have released three episodes so far. I don&#8217;t know how often they are putting them out, as only the first podcast is dated. There are unreleased recordings and assorted &#8220;stuff&#8221; in there. And they are really cool.</p>
<p>In other They Might Be Giants (TMBG) news, they are promoting a new DVD bundle of their Venue Songs. What is Venue Songs, you ask? On their site, they explain: &#8220;At each stop of their 2004 tour, TMBG wrote, arranged and performed a brand new song, dedicated to that evening&#8217;s venue. Hence the name, Venue Songs. Each song came together in one day, as a surprise for the audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Venue Songs DVD features original videos of the Venue Songs, and a weird story about a deranged millionaire that wants to lock up the Venue Songs forever. It makes for some silly watching, TMBG style!</p>
<p>TMBG are releasing the original Venue Songs videos, compressed for the web, on their website every week, one video for each &#8220;venue&#8221; in the album. There are also three bonus videos from the DVD on the site. They&#8217;re funny and goofy, just like the songs. I like them a lot!</p>
<p>The Venue Songs DVD also features a DVD-quality video of <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/expfilm.html">Homestarrunner&#8217;s &#8220;Experimental Film&#8221;</a> Flash cartoon episode, for which TMBG wrote an original song. ( If you don&#8217;t know <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com">Homestarrunner</a>, it&#8217;s the best Flash cartoon, ever! ) This video is not available on TMBG&#8217;s website, although you can see the original web-quality-sound Flash cartoon at the URL above.</p>
<p>Go check out They Might Be Giant&#8217;s podcast, and go check out Homestar Runner. They&#8217;re silly, zany, web-powered fun!</p>
