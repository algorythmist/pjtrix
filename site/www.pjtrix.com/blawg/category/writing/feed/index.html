				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From February to April, I was working evenings and weekends fulfilling a dream I&#8217;ve had for many decades: writing a book about a subject I really care about: game development. On June 22 2009, Apress is publishing a book I collaborated on as lead author and tech reviewer : <a href="http://iphonegamesbook.com">iPhone Games Projects</a>.<br />
<a href="http://iphonegamesbook.com"><br />
<img src="http://pjtrix.com/images/iPhoneGamesProjects-BookCover.jpg" alt="Book cover" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>There are chapters by :</p>
<ol>
<li>Olivier Hennessy &#038; Clayton Kane, of Posimotion, developers of Bikini Hunt and Apache Lander</li>
<li>Joachim Bondo, of Cocoa Stuff; developer of Deep Green, a beautiful chess game for iPhone</li>
<li>Richard Zito &#038; Matthew Aitken, of Swipe Interactive, developers of QuickDraw and Pole2Pole</li>
<li>Aaron Fothergill, of Strange Flavour, developer of Flick Sport Fishing, one of the top 20 best selling apps on the App Store</li>
<li>Brian Greenstone, of Pangea Software, developer of Enigmo and Cro-Mag Rally, two of the top 5 best selling apps on the App Store</li>
<li>Mike Kasprzak, of Sykhronics Entertainment; his game Smiles was one of the finalists for Best Mobile Game on the IGF Mobile 2009 competition</li>
<li>Mike Lee, co-founder of Tapulous, now at Apple, lead developer of Tap Tap Revenge, the most downloaded game on the history of the App Store</li>
<li>And a bonus free chapter by Jamie Gotch, of Subatomic Studios, developers of Fieldrunners, winner of Best Mobile Game on the IGF Mobile 2009 competition</li>
</ol>
<p>As tech reviewer for the book, I checked everyone&#8217;s writing for technical accuracy. That was really a great experience. I learned a lot and had fun running everyone&#8217;s sample code and checking their tips and tricks for myself.</p>
<p>I also wrote one chapter for the book, on how to implement RESTful web services for high score leaderboards and achievements on iPhone. There&#8217;s code in the chapter for a simple Rails web service, and native code for the iPhone as well. It&#8217;s a rather deep look at the subject.</p>
<p>I also collaborated with Jamie Gotch on a bonus free chapter. In the chapter we discussed getting started with programming for iPhone, a few tips and tricks, and the A* path finding algorithm. I also developed a Puyo clone and explained the most important parts of the code.</p>
<p>Full source code for the Puyo game will be provided. There is also source code for 3 other sample apps. All the sample code will be made available the same day as the book release <a href="http://iphonegamesbook.com">at the book&#8217;s support page</a> and at apress.com</p>
<p>This was a very neat experience for me. I&#8217;ve wanted to have my name on a computer book, and I&#8217;ve enjoyed programming games in my spare time, since before I was a teenager (more than 30 years ago, yo! Where has time gone?)</p>
<p>The iPhone gives me, and everyone with the interest, a chance to develop games for others, in a very cool platform with lots of traction. This book, coupled with <a href="http://bit.ly/iphskdbk-blog">Beginning iPhone Development</a>, can give you the tools to reach for the stars with your own creations! Enjoy!</p>
