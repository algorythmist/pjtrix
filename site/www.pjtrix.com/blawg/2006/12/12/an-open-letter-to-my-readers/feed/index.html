		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the advice, Ken! Dave, Mark, and you, are my reference points in measuring my own performance as a blogger. Let&#039;s see if I can be as prolific as the three of you, while staying true to my own calling :-)

OK, so that&#039;s three orders of arroz con pollo so far (Mark, you, and She WHo Must Be Obeyed.) I&#039;ll have to get cooking soon before I get a mutiny!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking as 50% of the Mac/NNW subscribers, I say write what ya&#039; know, what ya&#039; think, and what ya&#039; feel.

And I have nothing against arroz con pollo; SWMBO and I are always in search of new ideas for chicken night. :)

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mark! Long time no write!

I&#039;ll see what I can do for your arroz con pollo and Goya Sazon cravings. I&#039;m not a bad cook, but when it comes to rice, I cheat and use the easy Uncle Ben&#039;s 10 minute rice. :-)

Those are some cool digs you have over in Second Life. I&#039;m Peabody Ricardo over there. Haven&#039;t logged in, hmm, in like three months. Don&#039;t have any digs. It&#039;s just me, building stuff in open areas. I&#039;ll look you up, Chill!

I&#039;m still in PR, giving this self-employed thing an honest attempt before I decide to pack it in and go &quot;legit&quot; again. I am tempted to call it quits after the last 10 stressful and bumpy months, go back stateside and get a cushy traveling open source consultant job. Let&#039;s see what the next weeks bring.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi there.

Google Reader visits the RSS feed once a day, with this user agent:

&#039;FeedFetcher-Google; (+http://www.google.com/feedfetcher.html)&#039;

When you view my blog through Google Reader, it uses a combined user agent, like this:

&quot;http://www.google.com/reader/view/&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060601 Firefox/2.0 (Ubuntu-edgy)&quot; 

When you leave a comment, of course, your HTTP requests are identified with just your browser&#039;s user agent:

&quot;Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060601 Firefox/2.0 (Ubuntu-edgy)&quot;

Thanks for the feedback!]]></description>
